# PatternRec

A few notes:

1) The graphs and presentations are in the "Plots" and "Presentations" folders. These folders include all of our presentations and graphs

2) We DO NOT include the "admit.csv" file. It has a lot of data (255 MB), much too large to upload. Since Dr. Daugherity has the files, we didn't upload them.

3) The final code (excluding graphs) is in "FinalCode.ipny" and the graph code is in "GraphCode.ipny"

4) You will need python and jupyter notebooks installed to be able to run this code

5) Use "Individual.csv" to enter data on an individual student to analyze

6) Use "Test.csv" to enter data on multiple students to analyze
